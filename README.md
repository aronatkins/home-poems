# Home Poems

## by Daniel W. Hoyt

This repository contains a transcription of the privately published collection
of poetry. Daniel W. Hoyt is [my](https://github.com/aronatkins)
great-great-grandfather. My grandmother, Ruth (Wheeler) Atkins, was the
daughter of Ruth Williams (Hoyt) Wheeler, who was the daughter of Rev. Hoyt.

The biography in Home Poems mostly mirrors that in his [WikiTree
entry](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hoyt-579).

The copy of _Home Poems_ used for this transcription has been handed down
through my family. My copy came from my father.
