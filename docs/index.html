                    <p>
                        <span class="lead">These</span> poems were written, for the most part, to interest and amuse home
                        friends, and they are printed for the same reason. If they should be seen by
                        any of my larger circle of friends, let them remember from whence they came.

                    <p>
                        I am not without hopes, however, that expectant grandfathers among my friends
                        may see in these little effusions that a man may be old and yet be jolly and
                        companionable with the young folks.

                        <span class="lead">Rev. Daniel W. Hoyt</span>, author of the following poems, was born in East
                        Haverhill, Mass., August 12, 1845, son of Daniel Cate and Lydia (Williams)
                        Hoyt. He is a descendant of John Hoyt, one of the first settlers of Amesbury,
                        Mass., on both his father's and mother's side.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mr. Hoyt was enrolled, as a volunteer, in Company M, Fourth Massachusetts
                        Heavy Artillery, August 23, 1864, and was honorably discharged at Fort
                        Richardson, Virginia, June 17, 1865, at the close of the War. He is, at
                        present, Chaplain of Post 10, G. A. R.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He attended the New London Literary and Scientific Institution (now Colby
                        Academy), of New London, N. H. In 1865 and 1866, and entered Brown University,
                        Providence R. I. in 1867. He was President of his class in his Freshman year
                        and became a charter member of Delta Upsilon Fraternity. He was graduated in
                        1871, having been chosen Class Poet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next three years were spent at Newton Theological Institution, from which
                        school he was graduated in 1874.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mr. Hoyt was married October 21, 1874 to Miss Ella Dexter Mowry, of
                        Providence, R. I. She was born in Northbridge, Mass., January 17, 1848, the
                        daughter of John Dexter Mowry and Abigail Baylies (Prentice) Mowry. She died
                        January 17, 1922. Mr. and Mrs. Hoyt had five children: Mabel, Abbie Louise,
                        Enna Christine (Mrs. Delbert L. Judd), John Irving (who married Marion C.
                        Davis), and Ruth Williams (Mrs. Nelson H. Wheeler).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mr. Hoyt's first pastorate was in Amherst, Mass., from 1874 to 1880. From 1880
                        to 1889 he was pastor of the Baptist Church of Millbury, Mass.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 1889 he went to Worcester as City Missionary for the Baptist City Mission
                        Board, and was instrumental in founding the Adams Square Baptist Church, of
                        which he became the first pastor. He resigned in 1898 and devoted his
                        attention to farming for a few years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From 1906 to 1910 and again from 1912 to 1918 he was pastor of the Baptist
                        Church at North Oxford, Mass.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most of the following poems were written by Mr. Hoyt for his family or
                        friends. "A Sermon in Rhyme" was written in Amherst, Mass., and read one
                        evening at a gathering of friends in honor of one of the young ladies
                        connected with the church. This poem has often been printed, though seldom
                        with the name of the author attached. Judging by the clippings, letters, etc.,
                        received by Mr. Hoyt, in connection with this poem, it has proved helpful and
                        an inspiration to many.

                                If you have a friend worth loving,<br/>
                                Love him. Yes, and let him know<br/>
                                That you love him, ere life's evening<br/>
                                Tinge his brow with sunset glow.<br/>
                                Why should good words ne'er be said<br/>
                                Of a friend&mdash;till he is dead?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you hear a song that thrills you,<br/>
                                Sung by any child of song,<br/>
                                Praise it. Do not let the singer<br/>
                                Wait deserved praises long.<br/>
                                Why should one who thrills your heart<br/>
                                Lack the joy you may impart?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you hear a prayer that moves you<br/>
                                By its humble, pleading tone,<br/>
                                Join it. Do not yet the seeker<br/>
                                Bow before his God alone.<br/>
                                Why should not your brother share<br/>
                                The strength of "two or three" in prayer?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you see the hot tears falling<br/>
                                From a brother's weeping eyes,<br/>
                                Share them. And by kindly sharing<br/>
                                Own your kinship with the skies.<br/>
                                Why should any one be glad<br/>
                                When a brother's heart is sad?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If a silvery laugh goes rippling<br/>
                                Through the sunshine on his face,<br/>
                                Share it. 'Tis the wise man's saying<br/>
                                For both grief and joy a place.<br/>
                                There's health and goodness in the mirth<br/>
                                In which an honest laugh has birth.<br/>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you work is made more easy<br/>
                                By a friendly, helping hand,<br/>
                                Say so. Speak out brave and truly<br/>
                                Ere the darkness veil the land.<br/>
                                Should a brother workman dear<br/>
                                Falter for a word of cheer?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Scatter thus your seeds of kindness<br/>
                                All enriching as you go&mdash;<br/>
                                Leave them. Trust the Harvest Giver;<br/>
                                He will make each seed to grow.<br/>
                                So, until the happy end,<br/>
                                Your life shall never lack a friend.

                                &emsp;  Tread softly among the flowers, dear!

                                Have you heard of the parson who whistled his way<br/>
                                Through a pastorate thirty-odd year and a day?<br/>
                                Who in sunshine and shadow placed the best foot before,<br/>
                                And whistled, and whistled, just whistled the more?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When his sermon fell flat and his friends closed their eyes,<br/>
                                And his wife sat before him with wide-eyed surprise,<br/>
                                And the overhead comment had opened its sore,<br/>
                                He whistled and whistled, just whistled the more.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When the old folks grew cold and the young folks grew gay,<br/>
                                When his sturdy friends died and the rich moved away,<br/>
                                He up-girded his loins and strode on as before.<br/>
                                And whistled, and whistled, just whistled the more.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When his brethren boasted of their salaries large,<br/>
                                And the lay brother told him how to manage his charge,<br/>
                                And the holiness brother&mdash;of the garment he wore,<br/>
                                He whistled, and whistled, just whistled some more.

                                So his form rounded out and his face wore a smile,<br/>
                                And the man preached the gospel for many a mile,<br/>
                                While the sunnier he grew by the burdens he bore,<br/>
                                As he whistled, and whistled, just whistled the more.
                            </p>

                                &emsp;  They halt the thanks his due,<br/>
                                He heeds the grateful look, I ween,<br/>
                                &emsp;  The friendship, strong and true.<br/>
                                They're sure he'll do whate'er man can,<br/>
                                &emsp;  They're right, for they can trust the man.

                                Weird and strange is the story told<br/>
                                &emsp;  Of the toll-gate keeper,* quaint and old,<br/>
                                Who gathered the toll from one and all,<br/>
                                &emsp;  And raised the draw at a skipper's call.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                He dreamed that he heard at early morn<br/>
                                &emsp;  The sound of a schooner's signal horn,<br/>
                                And he took his place at the turning bar<br/>
                                &emsp;  And went his rounds to raise the draw.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Round and round, in his dream he was led,<br/>
                                &emsp;  Till the masts passed through and then fell dead.<br/>
                                Full of his dream and its grim portent,<br/>
                                &emsp;  He questioned his soul what the omen meant.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As he took his place on the bridge next morn<br/>
                                &emsp;  Sure enough he heard the signal horn,<br/>
                                And with full sails set&mdash;way up stream,<br/>
                                &emsp;  Saw the very same craft he had seen in his dream.

                            <p>
                                But he took his place at the turning bar,<br/>
                                &emsp;  And went his rounds to raise the draw,<br/>
                                And, with bated breath today it is said,<br/>
                                &emsp;  As the masts passed through&mdash;the keeper fell dead!

                                Being older than I, it was not very nice,<br/>

                                Did he seek this lone secluded place<br/>
                                &emsp;  To hide away from the white man's face?<br/>
                                Did he dream of a home across the strand?<br/>
                                &emsp;  Of some babbling brook in the black man's land?

                                But he linked his life with enduring fame<br/>
                                &emsp;  When he gave to the purling brook his name.

                                I sat by the side of a brook<br/>
                                &emsp;  At the close of a summer day,<br/>
                                And it told me a little tale,<br/>
                                &emsp;  As it gurgled and ran away.

                                I'm only a little brook, you know,<br/>
                                &emsp;  And there are things that puzzle me.

                                The one was a man with a hook and line,<br/>
                                &emsp;  The other, a maiden free.

                                And why did they look in each other's eyes,<br/>
                                &emsp;  You see I don't understand.

                                &emsp;  And kill her placid brow.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Poor, tired hands, toil-stained and marred<br/>
                                &emsp;  With tasks of four-score years;<br/>
                                For very love we will kiss them both,<br/>
                                &emsp;  Bedewing them with tears.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I feel them now upon my brow<br/>
                                &emsp;  In the hour of racking pain,<br/>
                                And I pillow my head upon her breast<br/>
                                &emsp;  In memory once again.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I hear the hum of the spinning wheel,<br/>
                                &emsp;  the hand drawn to and fro,<br/>
                                As the whirling roll of fleecy yarn<br/>
                                &emsp;  Doth on the spindle grow.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I see her coming across the fields,<br/>
                                &emsp;  In her hands the welcome bell,<br/>
                                Which she swings aloft with a merry din,<br/>
                                &emsp;  And call we knew full well.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I see them folded across her lap,<br/>
                                &emsp;  As we sat at the noontide meal,<br/>
                                While the sainted sire, in accents low,<br/>
                                &emsp;  Voiced our heaven-sent appeal.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Her shapely head I see, enshrined<br/>
                                &emsp;  In waves of silvery hair;<br/>
                                But her tired hands each mark and stain<br/>
                                &emsp;  For very love they bear.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Fold them gently across her breast,<br/>
                                &emsp;  The mother is resting now;<br/>
                                But we'll gather a wreath of immortelles<br/>
                                &emsp;  And place it about her brow.
                            </p>

                                My love who pledged her maiden troth<br/>
                                &emsp;  To walk through life with me<br/>
                                Lay dying, few the words she said,<br/>
                                &emsp;  Nor lisped what she could see.

                                Folk say I am eighty years old today,<br/>
                                &emsp;  But I say they tell not the truth;<br/>
                                In my early days I linked my life<br/>
                                &emsp;  With the source of eternal youth.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And I say I am eighty years young today,<br/>
                                &emsp;  With the heart of a care-free boy,<br/>
                                And I laugh and I cry in the same old way,<br/>
                                &emsp;  And I throb with the self-same joy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Folks say it is hardly the thing<br/>
                                &emsp;  To be cutting up pranks in old age;<br/>
                                But I say I prefer the joy of the child<br/>
                                &emsp;  To the wisdom and gloom of a sage.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Folks say an old man should be sober, sedate,<br/>
                                &emsp;  Like an autumn day, somber and sear,<br/>
                                But I say if you expect to be pleased in heaven,<br/>
                                &emsp;  You'd better keep pleased while you're here.

                                Into Grandfather's fold one fine summer day,<br/>
                                &emsp;  Two kiddies stole in the old, old way,<br/>
                                One was sweet as the breath of May,<br/>
                                &emsp;  One was sweet as new-mown hay.<br/>
                                And Grandfather felt as proud as a King,<br/>
                                &emsp;  As he trusted them both under Grandmother's wing!<br/>
                                But the mist of a tear came in Grandmother's eye,<br/>
                                &emsp;  As she thought of the days now long gone by,
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When her kiddies nestled about her knee<br/>
                                &emsp;  As little, and tender, and helpless, and wee,<br/>
                                All their shouts of joy and their cries of pain<br/>
                                &emsp;  Came ringing back from the past again!<br/>
                                Then she looked around on the women fair,<br/>
                                &emsp;  And the stalwart men who were gathered there,<br/>
                                And she smiled as she said, "Oh now, I see<br/>
                                &emsp;  Why my kiddies' kids are so dear to me!"

                                &emsp;  And a brook went straggling down.

                                &emsp;  Roamed through its thickets leafstrown.

                                But the axe and the scythe went forth one day,<br/>
                                &emsp;  Each with its edge so fine,<br/>
                                And the thorns and briers and thickets laid low,<br/>
                                &emsp;  The sprouts were left for the kine.

                                Not a seed was sown, and no cunning art<br/>
                                &emsp;  Interfered with nature's plan,<br/>
                                The kine ate their fill, but the soil remained<br/>
                                &emsp;  Untouched by the hand of man.

                                We hail the herald of thy word,<br/>
                                With joy, his mission to fulfill<br/>
                                Watch him approach to Zion's hill.

                                Say you the Prince of Peace is born?<br/>
                                Then sin's long night of death is o'er,<br/>
                                The Prince of Darkness reigns no more.

                                By waters still, in pastures green;<br/>
                                Lead thou his flock and onward guide<br/>
                                That we may safely reach his side.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Oh Bride of Christ! With aloes sweet<br/>
                                Perfume thy garments, make thee meet<br/>
                                To hear the bridegroom's welcome call,<br/>
                                Come home with me, my spouse, my all!

                                My grandpa is a naughty man,<br/>
                                He fools us children all he can.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                He found a chuck the other day,<br/>
                                And used him in a naughty way.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                He placed him on a little box<br/>
                                In the summer-house&mdash;the sly old fox!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And when we rushed the door&mdash;pell, mell!<br/>
                                O what an awful sight befell!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There by the door we'd entered in<br/>
                                Sat that old furry child of sin.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My, how we scream, how quick we flee!<br/>
                                O Mother, dear, please come and see!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                She came, but not a chuck was there,<br/>
                                In spite of all our awful scare.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For now you see our sly old fox<br/>
                                Had taken the chuck from off the box.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now Grandpa sat upon his stair<br/>
                                And joked with me, as unaware
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Of the fix his little folks were in<br/>
                                From that old furry child of sin.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Said Grandpa, "Look under the summer house,<br/>
                                Perhaps he's hunting for a mouse."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                They peeked, but saw no chuck astray,<br/>
                                But Grandpa's naughty plot saw they.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                They ran to tell him what was what,<br/>
                                And I spoke up, "I know a lot,
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And I've been tolded not to tell,<br/>
                                But Grandpa fooled you pretty well."

                                Pray dearie, cigarets eschew!<br/>
                                &emsp;  For always, when I think of you<br/>
                                I think of roses in full bloom,<br/>
                                &emsp;  And not of stale tobacco fume.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I think of dainty daffodils,<br/>
                                &emsp;  And music with its thousand thrills,<br/>
                                Of "linked sweetness long-drawn out,"<br/>
                                &emsp;  And grateful perfumes all about.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However could a man propose<br/>
                                &emsp;  If, always, he must hold his nose?<br/>
                                He'd pause, I trow, before he spoke<br/>
                                &emsp;  Did he but sniff tobacco smoke.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Don't say I'm preaching of a sin<br/>
                                &emsp;  That all the men are buried in,<br/>

                                Bobby spoke a piece today,<br/>
                                His very first, the children say.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Just after recess the hour was set,<br/>
                                And to Bobby the time seemed long, you bet!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But he forgot his task and his coming fate,<br/>
                                In a way that is truly sad to relate.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For in turning and twisting and running away<br/>
                                He broke in pieces his trousers' mainstay,
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And when the bell rang, with woeful grin,<br/>
                                Bobby said to himself, "What a fix I am in!"
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But he held them up with a shaking hand,<br/>
                                And made his bow at the teacher's command.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What the piece was about I am unable to say,<br/>
                                But there was a part of the lines that ran this way:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "Put strength and vigor in thy arm,<br/>
                                And courage in thy heart!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "Go forth to duty and to glory,<br/>
                                Proudly act thy part!"
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Thought Bobby "I can manage the first part,<br/>
                                And by shifting my grip, place my hand on my heart."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                He essayed the task like a valiant young knight,<br/>
                                He shifted his grip, first the left, then the right.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Thought Bobby, "I guess I'm through the first part,<br/>
                                I've stretched forth one arm, I've saluted my heart!
                            </p>

                                "Now!" he stretched forth both hands&mdash;it is better I ween,<br/>
                                To draw a curtain o'er the close of the scene!

                            <p>
                                Do you know how fresh a girl can be?<br/>
                                &emsp;  With a bashful feller&mdash;a feller like me?<br/>
                                Well I'll tell you what I know about girls,<br/>
                                &emsp;  They'll tangle you up with one toss of their curls!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There was Marjorie Dunn who came from the Point<br/>
                                &emsp;  And put all my young life out of joint,<br/>
                                She stayed about a week I venture to say<br/>
                                &emsp;  But it seemed a month ere she went away.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                She'd take a long feather and moisten the tip,<br/>
                                &emsp;  Somehow, I don't know how, perhaps by her lip,<br/>
                                And follow me 'round from place to place,<br/>
                                &emsp;  And steal up behind and tickle my face.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I tell you it makes a boy feel queer<br/>
                                &emsp;  To have a girl tickle him back of his ear.<br/>
                                Now haven't I made out my original plea,<br/>
                                &emsp;  That a girl can be fresh as fresh can be?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When I think of that girl and her naughty way,<br/>
                                &emsp;  It were better, yes, better, far better I say,<br/>
                                Oh Marjorie, Marjorie, Marjorie Dunn,<br/>
                                &emsp;  Had you been done before ever you were begun.

                                And I think I know something about boys,<br/>
                                &emsp;  They fill the whole house with clutter and noise,<br/>
                                They ruck up the carpet, tip over the stand,<br/>
                                &emsp;  And my! you ought to see a boy's hands.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And when supper is ready and all are in place,<br/>
                                &emsp;  Mother always says "Willie, now go wash your face!"<br/>
                                And "Willie, Willie, you're the plague of my life,<br/>
                                &emsp;  How oft have I told you not to eat with your knife!"

                            <p>
                                But there's Jimmie McFarden, he's awful nice,<br/>
                                &emsp;  That boy I tell you, can cut some ice!<br/>
                                He comes home from school with me most every day,<br/>
                                &emsp;  Though to do it he has to go way out of his way.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And he said to me the other day, he said to me, "Sue,<br/>
                                &emsp;  There's no other girl in the world like you!"<br/>
                                And he said another day, "When we are grown,<br/>
                                &emsp;  We'll have a limousine all our own!"
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And I told Mother and she said with a smile,<br/>
                                &emsp;  "Don't worry, my dear, that will take a good while,"<br/>
                                And she said another thing which I think was mean,<br/>
                                &emsp;  "You can't be engaged till Jimmie keeps his hands clean!"

                                The Post held its meeting in the usual way,<br/>

                                The red man in his feathered hood;<br/>
                                The miner delving in the soil;<br/>
                                The mill-saw screaming through the wood;<br/>
                                The housewife at her wonted toil.<br/>
                                Their Saxon love for self-control,<br/>
                                And ordered law and civil rule,<br/>
                                For freedom for each human soul&mdash;<br/>
                                For State and Town and Home and School.

                                They sleep beneath the sacred sod,<br/>
                                And we their weapons now must wield.
