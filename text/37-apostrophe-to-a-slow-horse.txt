APOSTROPHE TO A SLOW HORSE

*Slow, slow, slow, how like the wind you go!
What frolicsome fate makes you take such a gait,
You'll get winded, my boy, don't you know?

Slow, slow, slow, now round the corner you go,
While your main floweth out and the wheels slew about,
You'll tip me over some day, don't you know?

Slow, slow, slow, galloping up hill how you go!
While your hoofs as they pound make the echoes resound,
You'll be arrested for speeding, don't you know?

Slow, slow, slow, now into the stable you go,
How you steam and you sweat, both your flanks reeking wet,
'Tis pneumonia for you, don't you know?

*Substitute "woah" for "slow" in the above.
