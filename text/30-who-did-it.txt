WHO DID IT?

On a hillside sloping towards the east,
  Outside a busy town,
Grew brush and brier, and brake and thorn
  And a brook went straggling down.

No plowshare had troubled its deep shaded breast,
  While seventy years had flown,
The fox and the pheasant and the rabbit unscared
  Roamed through its thickets leafstrown.

But the axe and the scythe went forth one day,
  Each with its edge so fine,
And the thorns and briers and thickets laid low,
  The sprouts were left for the kine.

Not a seed was sown, and no cunning art
  Interfered with nature's plan,
The kine ate their fill, but the soil remained
  Untouched by the hand of man.

Two summers went by and a carpet of green
  Lay soft on each once barren clod,
Who did it? You say--well, what do you say?
  I reverently say it was God.
