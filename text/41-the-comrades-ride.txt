THE COMRADE'S RIDE

List to the story of Comrade Reed,
And the ride he took at laughable speed.

The Post held its meeting in the usual way,
The Relief Corps held theirs in the self-same day.

Now the stairway in Old Brindly was long and wide,
And while gaily descending, side by side

The jostled each other, and at once, and ker-flap!
The comrade sat down, a Relief in his lap.

The lady was heavy, and ker-jump, and ker-jump!
Down the stairway they went, to the very last bump!

Said Reed, looking up at the lady on top,
"Fair lady, you know this is where I stop!"

Said the lady arising, with a laugh and a cough,
"And, comrade, you know this is where I get off!"
