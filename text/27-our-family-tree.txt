OUR FAMILY TREE

There are Clarence and Marion and Charlotte, you see,
And room for one more, as you'll all agree,
Then Nelson Horatio and Ruth, in the line,
Though I've got them transposed in the order of time;
Then Ella and Webster, our next fine surprise,
There's no Hoyty in them, as you see by their eyes.
Why, Danny and Chrissie I almost forgot,
They are here, they are there, they are all over the lot,
Hi! Johnny and Billy step onto the screen,
As chubby young Cupids as ever were seen,
And here's little Esther, to make her debut,
But one girl's not enough--there had better be two.
Well, trot them along--they are welcome you see,
And there's room for them all on our family tree.
