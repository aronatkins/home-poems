ABOUT BOYS

And I think I know something about boys,
  They fill the whole house with clutter and noise,
They ruck up the carpet, tip over the stand,
  And my! you ought to see a boy's hands.

And when supper is ready and all are in place,
  Mother always says "Willie, now go wash your face!"
And "Willie, Willie, you're the plague of my life,
  How oft have I told you not to eat with your knife!"

But there's Jimmie McFarden, he's awful nice,
  That boy I tell you, can cut some ice!
He comes home from school with me most every day,
  Though to do it he has to go way out of his way.

And he said to me the other day, he said to me, "Sue,
  There's no other girl in the world like you!"
And he said another day, "When we are grown,
  We'll have a limousine all our own!"

And I told Mother and she said with a smile,
  "Don't worry, my dear, that will take a good while,"
And she said another thing which I think was mean,
  "You can't be engaged till Jimmie keeps his hands clean!"
