CHRISSIE TELLS

My grandpa is a naughty man,
He fools us children all he can.

He found a chuck the other day,
And used him in a naughty way.

He placed him on a little box
In the summer-house--the sly old fox!

And when we rushed the door--pell, mell!
O what an awful sight befell!

There by the door we'd entered in
Sat that old furry child of sin.

My, how we scream, how quick we flee!
O Mother, dear, please come and see!

She came, but not a chuck was there,
In spite of all our awful scare.

For now you see our sly old fox
Had taken the chuck from off the box.

Now Grandpa sat upon his stair
And joked with me, as unaware

Of the fix his little folks were in
From that old furry child of sin.

Said Grandpa, "Look under the summer house,
Perhaps he's hunting for a mouse."

They peeked, but saw no chuck astray,
But Grandpa's naughty plot saw they.

They ran to tell him what was what,
And I spoke up, "I know a lot,

And I've been tolded not to tell,
But Grandpa fooled you pretty well."
