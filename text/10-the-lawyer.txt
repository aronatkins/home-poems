THE LAWYER

The aforesaid lawyer takes the stand,
  Said stand his sanctum being,
Not mentioned prior, heretofore,
  By deponent drawn as seeing.

If hereinafter named, described,
  Or tried without a hearing,
Said party of the first part should
  Himself or proxy-wise appearing.

Declare, depose or otherwise maintain,
  Or cause to be maintained,
That part of the second part,
  His calling has defamed--

Then by these presents know all men,
  That nothing more is meant
Than to unroll the real law man
  From ideal wrappings lent.

With Coke and Blackstone on his shelf,
  And shrewdness in his head,
He'd prove, despite your eyes and ears,
  A living man was dead.

And with his jargon of law terms,
  So craze your wearied brain,
That you would deed your soul away,
  And think it to your gain.

Instead of cases on which hang
  The common ill or good,
He sues for fees and trespass claims,
  And often he gets sued.

Will Shakespeare was a clergyman,
  For aught our lawyer knows,
And Robbie Burns a convent kept,
  Amid the Alpine snows.

Some good traits yet our lawyer hath,
  Instilled by Mother Brown,
He'll ne'er forget his birthday suit,
  Her black old swaddling gown.

And while the stars above him shine,
  And while the sea shall roll,
Fond memories of college shall
  Make music in his soul.

And should his outward acts say "rogue,"
  Maybe there dwells within,
Less of that low God-hated vice,
  The secret, selfish sin.

For since his calling lets him loose,
  To prey on others' wealth,
He ought to keep his ego in
  The very best of health.
