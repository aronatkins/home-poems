A CAUTION
(After Anacreon)

As sometimes in a tangled nook,
  With hanging boughs o'erhead,
In counterfeit of nature's look,
  The artful net is spread.

So Cupid, by some cunning fraud,
  Oft sends his deadly dart--
And oft makes use of flattering word,
  To pierce the maiden's heart.

Her ruby lips outvie the wine,
  Her neck's like driven snow,
Her kiss would thrill the gods divine,
  Her smile is heaven below.

Believe it or not; were these things true,
  Or half that's told you, sighing,
The stars themselves would stoop to you,
  Love is a prince at lying.

The joy and bliss of love's young dream,
  Rest not on fact, but seeming,
Those sighs, should truth be known, I ween,
  Would have far other meaning.
