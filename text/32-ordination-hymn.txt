ORDINATION HYMN
(Written for the ordination of a classmate, J. K. Ewer)

In thine own temple, blessed Lord,
We hail the herald of thy word,
With joy, his mission to fulfill
Watch him approach to Zion's hill.

Ho! Watchman, doth the morning dawn?
Say you the Prince of Peace is born?
Then sin's long night of death is o'er,
The Prince of Darkness reigns no more.

Ho! Shepherd! We the Lord have seen
By waters still, in pastures green;
Lead thou his flock and onward guide
That we may safely reach his side.

Oh Bride of Christ! With aloes sweet
Perfume thy garments, make thee meet
To hear the bridegroom's welcome call,
Come home with me, my spouse, my all!

Crown Thou, blest Spirit, with Thy grace
The solemn service of this place
And grant to him who waiting stands
The Spirit's laying on of hands
