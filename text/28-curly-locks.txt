CURLY LOCKS

I love a little maiden,
  As fair as any maid I know,
But if I ask her if she loves me,
  She shakes her curls and answers, "No."

Come to me, my little maiden,
  Grandpa loves you so,
Gliding past me, eyes a-sparkling,
  She shakes her curls and answers, "No!"

Dimpled arms around me pressing,
  Kisses raining, one free, fo,
But if I venture, "Now you love me,"
  She shakes her curls and answers, "No."

Well, my little dimpled maiden,
  You'll be happy, this I know,
If you learn, while you are little,
  To shake your curls and answer, "No!"
