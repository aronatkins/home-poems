FOREWORD

These poems were written, for the most part, to interest and amuse home
friends, and they are printed for the same reason. If they should be seen by
any of my larger circle of friends, let them remember from whence they came.

I am not without hopes, however, that expectant grandfathers among my friends
my see in these little effusions that a man may be old and yet be jolly and
companionable with the young folks.
