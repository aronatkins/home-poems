THE BROOK'S QUESTION

I sat by the side of a brook
  At the close of a summer day,
And it told me a little tale,
  As it gurgled and ran away.

Said the brook, "I've a story to tell,
  And a question to ask of thee,
I'm only a little brook, you know,
  And there are things that puzzle me.

"Two fishers sat on yon mossy stone,
  As close as close could be,
The one was a man with a hook and line,
  The other, a maiden free.

"Why didn't he mind his line, you know?
  And why did he hold her hand?
And why did they look in each other's eyes,
  You see I don't understand.

"And why did he kiss her on the lips
  And why was he not afraid?
Was he fishing for a little trout?
  Or was he fishing for a maid?"
