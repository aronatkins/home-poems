THE WAYSIDE WELL

You turn and you turn, with might and main,
  And the water climbs up the endless chain,
And from the iron spout goes gurgling forth,
  And flows away in the waste water trough.

And you take the cup with the dangling chain,
  And you drink and you drink and you drink again,
And you bless the thought of the kindly pair,
  Who have left the well by the wayside there.

Now a group of children, with scurrying feet,
  Now a travel-stained pilgrim, oppressed with the heat,
Now a touring party, returning to town,
  From their glittering car step lightly down.

All drink at the well, and going their way,
  Remember its sweetness for many a day,
And a cup of cold water given in love
  Ne'er fails of reward from the Father above
