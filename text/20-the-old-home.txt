THE OLD HOME

Oh, home of my childhood, humble cot,
  Where my mother's nestlings grew,
Whene'er I roam through memory's halls
  I backward turn to you.

For love makes home and a father's care,
  And a mother's sheltering arms,
Nor shield not buckler nor castle walls
  So shelter from earth's alarms!

I know the spot where I set my traps,
  Where the towering pine grew,
And I know the pond where the spreading pads
  Their lily harvest strew.

I know the road past the old saw mill,
  And the lover's walk to Brandy Brow,
With its beetling rock, and the laurels sweet
  And where the four-leaved clovers grow.

I know the place where the sturgeons jump
  From the river's gleaming tide.
Sometimes you see them and sometimes you see
  The lass who sits by your side.

The little schoolhouse in the cleft of the road,
  Where I learned my A B C,
And the boys and the girls of long ago,
  Who will never come back to me.

My father and mother who taught me to pray,
  And led me to their God,
My brothers and sisters now silent in death,
  Asleep 'neath the sacred sod

Save one, the jolliest lad of a,,
  With the heart of a little boy,
Together we travel the upward road
  And thrill with the self-same joy.

O home of our childhood, humble cot,
  Where our mother's nestlings grew,
Where'er we roam throughout the world
  We'll backward turn to you
