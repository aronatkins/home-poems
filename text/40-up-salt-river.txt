UP SALT RIVER

Now what in the world are we going to do,
  And how get out of this terrible fix?
We are finding at last and finding it true,
  What a sickening brew the fates can mix!

The flour barrel's empty, the butter's most gone,
  The sugar has vanished, and so has the bread,
The bottom of the coal bin is left all alone,
  And you know very well what the milkman said.

You, wife, need a dress, and the children need shoes,
  The 'phone bill and light bill are both a month old,
The church Treasurer says I'm behind in my dues,
  And they'll shut off the water, so we are told.

My trousers are baggy, my coat is threadbare,
  My tax bill is overdue, so it the rent,
My hat looks decidedly worse for the wear,
  And here we are stranded without a red cent.

Now speak it out quickly, wife, what shall we do?
  If you see any light without or within?
Pray, what shall we do, wife, now tell me true?
  "Keep pegging away till our ship comes in!"
