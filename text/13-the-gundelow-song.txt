THE GUNDELOW SONG

Down by the shore of the salt, salt sea,
  Where the sand-dunes stay its flow,
And the sea gulls float in the azure vault,
  Come memories of long ago.

And I catch the breath of the salt marsh air,
  Where the gundelow lies in the bay,
And I join the group of sturdy men,
  Who fill it with new-mown hay.

But the pulsing tide comes flooding in,
  The boat rocks to and fro,
As the dripping oars keep rhythmic time,
  As up the river we go.

"Pull!" cries the Skipper, who stands at the helm,
  "Pull as you never did before,
We must make the river upon this tide,
  Pull as your fathers pulled of yore!"

Strong of muscle and broad of back,
  The mighty oars they swing,
They quicken the stroke at the Skipper's call,
  And the Gundelow Song they sing.

"Yo ho! Yo ho! my hearties,
  Yo ho! Yo ho! Yo ho!
Pull, my lads, till your muscles crack,
  Yo ho! Yo ho! Yo ho!"

Up the river of story and song,
  Up the river we go,
"Pull, my hearties, pull steady and strong,
  Yo ho! Yo ho! Yo ho!"
