ABOUT GIRLS
Marjorie Dunn

Do you know how fresh a girl can be?
  With a bashful feller--a feller like me?
Well I'll tell you what I know about girls,
  They'll tangle you up with one toss of their curls!

There was Marjorie Dunn who came from the Point
  And put all my young life out of joint,
She stayed about a week I venture to say
  But it seemed a month ere she went away.

She'd take a long feather and moisten the tip,
  Somehow, I don't know how, perhaps by her lip,
And follow me 'round from place to place,
  And steal up behind and tickle my face.

I tell you it makes a boy feel queer
  To have a girl tickle him back of his ear.
Now haven't I made out my original plea,
  That a girl can be fresh as fresh can be?

When I think of that girl and her naughty way,
  It were better, yes, better, far better I say,
Oh Marjorie, Marjorie, Marjorie Dunn,
  Had you been done before ever you were begun.
