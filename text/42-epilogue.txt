*EPILOGUE

We children of those sainted sires,
Who dared the wilderness to brave,
Who built for us their altar fires,
And for our weal their hostage gave,
Have drawn aside the veil that screens
Those quaint but manly old-time days,
Have sketched anew the frontier scenes
And our forefathers' simple ways.
The red man in his feathered hood;
The miner delving in the soil;
The mill-saw screaming through the wood;
The housewife at her wonted toil.
Their Saxon love for self-control,
And ordered law and civil rule,
For freedom for each human soul--
For State and Town and Home and School.

* * *

Brave leaders in the Church of God,
Brave warriors in the tented field;
They sleep beneath the sacred sod,
And we their weapons now must wield.

* * *

Strong children of each gallant soul,
Gird thou thy children for the fray:
This be their rallying cry-- their goal--
"For God and town and home alway!"

*Written for Pageant, Westhampton, Mass., June 27, 1928
