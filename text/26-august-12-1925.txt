AUGUST 12, 1925

Folk say I am eighty years old today,
  But I say they tell not the truth;
In my early days I linked my life
  With the source of eternal youth.

And I say I am eighty years young today,
  With the heart of a care-free boy,
And I laugh and I cry in the same old way,
  And I throb with the self-same joy.

Folks say it is hardly the thing
  To be cutting up pranks in old age;
But I say I prefer the joy of the child
  To the wisdom and gloom of a sage.

Folks say an old man should be sober, sedate,
  Like an autumn day, somber and sear,
But I say if you expect to be pleased in heaven,
  You'd better keep pleased while you're here.
