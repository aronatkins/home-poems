THE TWO KIDS

Into Grandfather's fold one fine summer day,
  Two kiddies stole in the old, old way,
One was sweet as the breath of May,
  One was sweet as new-mown hay.
And Grandfather felt as proud as a King,
  As he trusted them both under Grandmother's wing!
But the mist of a tear came in Grandmother's eye,
  As she thought of the days now long gone by,

When her kiddies nestled about her knee
  As little, and tender, and helpless, and wee,
All their shouts of joy and their cries of pain
  Came ringing back from the past again!
Then she looked around on the women fair,
  And the stalwart men who were gathered there,
And she smiled as she said, "Oh now, I see
  Why my kiddies' kids are so dear to me!"
