MY GRANDDAUGHTERS

Marion dear, thou maiden fair,
  With velvet cheek and browny hair,
I could love thee, gentle maid,
  But I am afraid, oh, I am afraid!
"Piggly, Wiggly, Sir," she said.

Charlotte dear, thou hast dove's eyes,
  All filled with wonder and surprise,
Were I your mate, I'd fly with you,
  To yonder roof and bill and coo!
"Piggly, Wiggly, Sir," she said.

Ella dear, the lightnings dart,
  From your dark eyes and pierce my heart!
Pray do not turn your face away,
  And leave me in this sad dismay!
"Piggly, Wiggly, Sir," she said.

Ruthie, dear, you blushing rose,
  Have pity on a lover's woes,
Were I a happy, healthy boy,
  I know where I would seek my joy.
"Piggly, Wiggly, Sir," she said.

Chrissie, dear, sit on my knee!
  We'll sit as close as close can be,
Have pity on your old Grandad,
  He wants a kiss most awful bad.
"Piggly, Wiggly, Sir," she said.

Esther, dear, in Mamma's arms,
  With all thy little baby charms,
What is this I hear from you?
  "Googly-googly-googly-goo!"
Why "Piggly, Wiggly" just the same!

What mean these "Piggly, Wiggly" girls,
  Who laugh at me and shake their curls?
Why, 'Piggly, Wiggly' means, dull elf,
  Just help yourself, just help yourself
