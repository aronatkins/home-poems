BOBBY SPEAKS A PIECE

Bobby spoke a piece today,
His very first, the children say.

Just after recess the hour was set,
And to Bobby the time seemed long, you bet!

But he forgot his task and his coming fate,
In a way that is truly sad to relate.

For in turning and twisting and running away
He broke in pieces his trousers' mainstay,

And when the bell rang, with woeful grin,
Bobby said to himself, "What a fix I am in!"

But he held them up with a shaking hand,
And made his bow at the teacher's command.

What the piece was about I am unable to say,
But there was a part of the lines that ran this way:

"Put strength and vigor in thy arm,
And courage in thy heart!

"Go forth to duty and to glory,
Proudly act thy part!"

Thought Bobby "I can manage the first part,
And by shifting my grip, place my hand on my heart."

He essayed the task like a valiant young knight,
He shifted his grip, first the left, then the right.

Thought Bobby, "I guess I'm through the first part,
I've stretched forth one arm, I've saluted my heart!

"Now!" he stretched forth both hands--it is better I ween,
To draw a curtain o'er the close of the scene!
