MY DOCTOR

I trust he knows my earthly frame,
  And sees me through and through,
I trust he knows each human ill,
  And knows just what to do.
I trust he'll do whate'er man can
  But, best of all, I trust the man.

He goes his rounds, from house to house,
  At frailties' beck and call,
He softens every dying bed,
  He's welcomed by them all.
They know he'll do whate'er man can,
  For they're like me, they trust the man.

And though absorbed in their own grief,
  They halt the thanks his due,
He heeds the grateful look, I ween,
  The friendship, strong and true.
They're sure he'll do whate'er man can,
  They're right, for they can trust the man.
