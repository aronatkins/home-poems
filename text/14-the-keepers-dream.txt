THE KEEPER'S DREAM

Weird and strange is the story told
  Of the toll-gate keeper,* quaint and old,
Who gathered the toll from one and all,
  And raised the draw at a skipper's call.

He dreamed that he heard at early morn
  The sound of a schooner's signal horn,
And he took his place at the turning bar
  And went his rounds to raise the draw.

Round and round, in his dream he was led,
  Till the masts passed through and then fell dead.
Full of his dream and its grim portent,
  He questioned his soul what the omen meant.

As he took his place on the bridge next morn
  Sure enough he heard the signal horn,
And with full sails set--way up stream,
  Saw the very same craft he had seen in his dream.

But he took his place at the turning bar,
  And went his rounds to raise the draw,
And, with bated breath today it is said,
  As the masts passed through--the keeper fell dead!

Crossing the bridge with my sister one day,
  She told me this tale in an awesome way.
Being older than I, it was not very nice,
  For she scared me so--I recrossed on the ice!

*At Rocks Bridge.
