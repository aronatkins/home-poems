PRINCE'S BROOK

You step aside from the narrow lane
  Where briers grow and raspberry cane,
And you stand at once on the very spot
  Where the black man built his humble cot.

A slave far away from his native soil,
  His back was bent with daily toil;
But here in this quiet vale, you see,
  Though a black man still, his soul was free.

Did he seek this lone secluded place
  To hide away from the white man's face?
Did he dream of a home across the strand?
  Of some babbling brook in the black man's land?

Nobody saw the black man die;
  Nobody knows where his ashes lie;
But he linked his life with enduring fame
  When he gave to the purling brook his name.
