J'IMPLORE!

Pray dearie, cigarets eschew!
  For always, when I think of you
I think of roses in full bloom,
  And not of stale tobacco fume.

I think of dainty daffodils,
  And music with its thousand thrills,
Of "linked sweetness long-drawn out,"
  And grateful perfumes all about.

However could a man propose
  If, always, he must hold his nose?
He'd pause, I trow, before he spoke
  Did he but sniff tobacco smoke.

Don't say I'm preaching of a sin
  That all the men are buried in,
I know--but it is true, I ween,
  That life is sweetest when 'tis clean!
