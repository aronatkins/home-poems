HYMN
(Written for the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Church
in East Haverhill, Mass.)

Today our hearts are singing,
With old-time gladness light,
And merry bells are ringing,
While every face is bright;
For o'er our mounds of sorrow
And o'er our hills of pain
Looks forth a glad tomorrow,
The sunshine after rain.

From Zion's streets of glory
Sounds forth an answering song,
They sing the same old story,
Amid the ransomed throng.
With faces we remember,
With voices we have known,
In accents warm and tender,
They praise the Lord alone.

Lord, in this sweet communion,
The family above
And that on earth in union,
May join in holy love.
So send Thy gracious blessing,
And blend our hearts in one,
Through us Thy name confessing,
Thy will on earth be done.
