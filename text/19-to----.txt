TO _ _ _ _

I mind me of an Eastern tale,
  In some old musty tome,
Whose curious look, enticed my eyes
  Its yellow leaves to roam.

There lived, at least so runs the tale,
  A wondrous little elf,
Whose height was only one foot six,
  In this, not like yourself.

But strange the story to relate!
  His whiskers knew no bound,
Full thirty feet they lengthened out,
  Encircling him around

His upper lip a mustache bore,
  In this resembling you;
And 'neath his ears it,  stretching back,
  Luxuriant, daily grew.

Ten barbers could not keep it down,
  And yet, there was a time,
When only now and then a hair
  Appeared, like yours, in fine.

Forgive the thought that friendship prompts;
  You'll sometime rue, I know,
That constant care and loving strokes
  Enticed your down to grow.
