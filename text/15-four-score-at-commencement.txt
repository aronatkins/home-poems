FOUR-SCORE AT COMMENCEMENT

Half-way up the towering height,
  Above the crowded town,
With its noisy clatter of busy life,
Its endless chatter of bartering strife,
  An old man sat him down.

"I've come," he said to a passer-by,
  "To greet old friends once more,
And roam again 'neath the grateful shade
Of the spreading elms, where oft I strayed,
  In careless days of yore.

"But I am old; these locks are white, my son,
  And faltering every limb,
My strength is gone, I scarce can tell,
The old landmarks I once knew well,
  My eyes are grown so dim.

"This steep up which I climbed in youth,
  With springing, tireless tread,
I have found today beyond my strength,
And I'm sitting here to rest at length,
  With this leafy dome o'erhead.

"Ah, life's a dream; we are dreamers all,
  The child, the youth, the sage,
Do we wait, amid the wreck of years,
Or in manhood's strength of childhood's fears,
  We dream with every age."

Once more I saw the old man gray,
  Amid a festal throng,
His sadness had vanished, and young again.
With the old companions, white-haired men,
  He joined in jest and song.

No fount of youth, no fairy elf,
  Hath e'er so potent charm,
To warm the blood in the aged veins
And quicken anew the pulse that wanes,
  As young life's thrilling psalm.

Old men grow young, and sad hearts gay,
  In Alma Mater's halls,
As memory rings the changes out,
Of each joyous day and youthful bout,
  Beneath her gray old walls.
