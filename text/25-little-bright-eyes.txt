LITTLE BRIGHT EYES

Little Bright Eyes, come to me,
  I am waiting, don't you see?
Waiting for those tiny arms,
  With all their little dimpled charms
To twine about my neck, you seem,
  Little Bright Eyes, come to me!

In my fold are gathering all,
  Other lambkins great and small,
One brown lamb is still away,
  Little lambkin, haste, I pray!
Little Bright Eyes, come to me,
  I am waiting, don't you see?

Take your Daddy on one arm,
  On the other take your Marm,
Pack your trunk all full of things,
  Then on lightning's speedy wings,
Little Bright Eyes, come to me,
  I am waiting, don't you see?
