AT CHURCH

Within this sacred house of God,
  Whose aisles our sainted dead have trod,
I lift again the voice of praise,
  And celebrate His wondrous ways.

I praise Him that I still may praise,
  And to the Lord thanksgivings raise,
I pray Him and I still will pray,
  And find new blessings every day.

Here may my soul find solace rare,
  And here let me be free from care,
Let holy musings reign within,
  And here let me be kept from sin.

Here find the message that I need,
  And here God's holy warnings heed,
Here learn to sacrifice for Thee,
  Who made such sacrifice for me.
