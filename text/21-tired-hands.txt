TIRED HANDS
(My Mother)

Fold them gently across her breast,
  The mother is resting now;
and the children gather around her couch,
  And kill her placid brow.

Poor, tired hands, toil-stained and marred
  With tasks of four-score years;
For very love we will kiss them both,
  Bedewing them with tears.

I feel them now upon my brow
  In the hour of racking pain,
And I pillow my head upon her breast
  In memory once again.

I hear the hum of the spinning wheel,
  the hand drawn to and fro,
As the whirling roll of fleecy yarn
  Doth on the spindle grow.

I see her coming across the fields,
  In her hands the welcome bell,
Which she swings aloft with a merry din,
  And call we knew full well.

I see them folded across her lap,
  As we sat at the noontide meal,
While the sainted sire, in accents low,
  Voiced our heaven-sent appeal.

Her shapely head I see, enshrined
  In waves of silvery hair;
But her tired hands each mark and stain
  For very love they bear.

Fold them gently across her breast,
  The mother is resting now;
But we'll gather a wreath of immortelles
  And place it about her brow.

Worcester, Mass., 1890.
