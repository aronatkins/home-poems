THE QUAKERESS

With holy light thy face aglow,
  All love's sweet lessons though dids't know;
Mid vanished years thy voice I hear,
  "Tread softly among the flowers, dear!"

For hearts do break and hopes may die,
  And faith in ruins prone may lie;
If thou must chide and cans't not cheer,
  Tread softly among the flowers, dear!

If childhood's prattle on thee cloy,
  Or garrulous old age thee annoy,
At life's twin portals thou art near,
  Tread softly among the flowers, dear!

As Christ by Sea of Galliee
  To erring Peter: "Lovs't thou me?"
So win by love and not by fear,
  Tread softly among the flowers, dear!
