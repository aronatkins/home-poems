PARAPHRASE OF HORACE'S RULE FOR THE
COMMENCEMENT OF A POEM

(Epistola ad Pisones)

Your poet must have life and fire,
Go quick to work lest you will tire,
From long, far-fetched beginnings, free
In medias res draw you and me
And hastening ever to the end
Leave this as bad, this polish lend,
So he must mingle false and true,
His story tell, though facts be few,
That e'en the critic's caustic art
Shall find no inconsistent part.
