TO _ _ _ _
January 18, 1874

Two eyes, as black as starless night,
  And eloquent with love;
Two lips, where kisses fly to light,
  As to her cot, the dove.

Two cheeks, which mantle with a blush,
  To hear their praises sung;
Two ears, that oft, in evening's hush,
  With tales of love have rung.

Two hands that know each cunning art,
  And knowing, love to do;
Two feed, that trip a merry part,
  Life's tangled mazes through.

And hair, as black as raven's wing,
  And heart, so fond and true!
Such are the gifts whose praise I sing,
  Such charms belong to you.
