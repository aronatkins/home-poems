ON The BORDER LAND

With My Love

My love who pledged her maiden troth
  To walk through life with me
Lay dying, few the words she said,
  Nor lisped what she could see.

But faith and love shone in her eyes,
  And at the close of day,
The glory of the Lord came down,
  And rapt my love away.

Alone

And now, alone I sit and ask,
  How will it be with me?
Will favoring winds blow soft and low,
  When I sail out to sea?

Will darkness veil me with its shroud,
  And terror seize my hand?
Or will the light that lit my love,
  Light me across the strand?

Yet Not Alone

Above the din of this world's doubt,
  And over the stormy sea,
Where rocks my bark on foaming crests,
  I hear His "Come to me!"

And in the friends that still remain,
  His pledge of live I see,
And in the hour of prayer I hear
  "I, soul, will be with thee!"
