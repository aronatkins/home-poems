OLD FRIENDS

You may search through the east, you may search
    through the west,
  You may measure their charms or their gold,
But the kindliest friends, the friends you love best,
  Are the dear-faced friends of old.

When in far-distant lands you are lonely and sad,
  And strange scenes like the night you enfold,
There is naught that can cheer, there is naught can make
    glad,
  Like the dear-faced friends of old.

So the days they may come and the days may go by,
  But our love it shall never grow cold,
For we'll cherish forever, yes forever and aye,
  The dear-faced friends of old.
