THE WHISTLING PARSON

Have you heard of the parson who whistled his way
Through a pastorate thirty-odd year and a day?
Who in sunshine and shadow placed the best foot before,
And whistled, and whistled, just whistled the more?

When his sermon fell flat and his friends closed their
    eyes,
And his wife sat before him with wide-eyed surprise,
And the overhead comment had opened its sore,
He whistled and whistled, just whistled the more.

When the old folks grew cold and the young folks grey
    gay,
When his sturdy friends died and the rich moved away,
He up-girded his loins and strode on as before.
And whistled, and whistled, just whistled the more.

When his brethren boasted of their salaries large,
And the lay brother told him how to manage his charge,
And the holiness brother--of the garment he wore,
He whistled, and whistled, just whistled some more.

So his form rounded out and his face wore a smile,
And the man preached the gospel for many a mile,
While the sunnier he grew by the burdens he bore,
As he whistled, and whistled, just whistled the more.

When he died there was placed in the churchyard old
What I think was far better than silver or gold;
For with warm, loving fingers they chiseled in stone,
This legend: He carried all cares but his own.
